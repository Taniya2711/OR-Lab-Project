# OR-Lab-Project
We worked on "Multi-Objective Optimal Power Flow on the IEEE 14-Bus Test System" where we used MATPOWER for the dataset and MATLAB for running our code files. We used the Weighted-sum approach , followed by the Pareto front analysis and implemented the objective function, as mentioned in our report for this project.
